  Please specify how the list of domain names that will be included in the
  certificate should be determined. If you choose for one of the "all bindings"
  options, the list will automatically be updated for future renewals to
  reflect the bindings at that time.

 1: IIS
 2: Manual input
 3: CSR created by another program
 C: Abort

 How shall we determine the domain(s) to include in the certificate?: 3

 Enter the path to the CSR: "C:\wacs\crt\Новая папка\1.txt"

 File C:\Windows\system32\"C:\wacs\crt\Новая папка\1.txt" does not exist

 Enter the path to the CSR: "C:\wacs\crt\1.txt"

 File C:\Windows\system32\"C:\wacs\crt\1.txt" does not exist

 Enter the path to the CSR: C:\wacs\crt\1.txt

 Enter the path to the corresponding private key, or <ENTER> to create a certificate without one: <Enter>

 Target generated using plugin CSR: directumdm.ru

 Suggested friendly name '[Csr] C:\wacs\crt\1.txt', press <ENTER> to accept or type an alternative: <Enter>

  The ACME server will need to verify that you are the owner of the domain
  names that you are requesting the certificate for. This happens both during
  initial setup *and* for every future renewal. There are two main methods of
  doing so: answering specific http requests (http-01) or create specific dns
  records (dns-01). For wildcard domains the latter is the only option. Various
  additional plugins are available from https://github.com/win-acme/win-acme/.

 1: [http-01] Save verification files on (network) path
 2: [http-01] Serve verification files from memory
 3: [http-01] Upload verification files via FTP(S)
 4: [http-01] Upload verification files via SSH-FTP
 5: [http-01] Upload verification files via WebDav
 6: [dns-01] Create verification records manually (auto-renew not possible)
 7: [dns-01] Create verification records with acme-dns (https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns)
 8: [dns-01] Create verification records with your own script
 9: [tls-alpn-01] Answer TLS verification request from win-acme
 C: Abort

 How would you like prove ownership for the domain(s) in the certificate?: 2

  When we have the certificate, you can store in one or more ways to make it
  accessible to your applications. The Windows Certificate Store is the default
  location for IIS (unless you are managing a cluster of them).

 1: IIS Central Certificate Store (.pfx per domain)
 2: PEM encoded files (Apache, nginx, etc.)
 3: Windows Certificate Store
 4: No (additional) store steps
 C: Abort

 How would you like to store the certificate?: 1

 Path to Central Certificate Store: C:\wacs\crt\sertstore

 Password to use for the PFX files, or enter for none:

 1: PEM encoded files (Apache, nginx, etc.)
 2: Windows Certificate Store
 3: No (additional) store steps
 C: Abort

 Would you like to store it in another way too?: 3

  With the certificate saved to the store(s) of your choice, you may choose one
  or more steps to update your applications, e.g. to configure the new
  thumbprint, or to update bindings.

 1: Create or update https bindings in IIS
 2: Create or update ftps bindings in IIS
 3: Start external script or program
 4: No (additional) installation steps

 Which installation step should run first?: 4
