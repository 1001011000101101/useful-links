 Please specify how the list of domain names that will be included in the
 certificate should be determined. If you choose for one of the "all bindings"
 options, the list will automatically be updated for future renewals to
 reflect the bindings at that time.

 1: Read bindings from IIS
 2: Manual input
 3: CSR created by another program
 C: Abort

 How shall we determine the domain(s) to include in the certificate?: 1

 Please select which website(s) should be scanned for host names. You may
 input one or more site identifiers (comma-separated) to filter by those
 sites, or alternatively leave the input empty to scan *all* websites.

 2: DirectumRX Web Site Name (1 binding)

 Site identifier(s) or <Enter> to choose all: <Enter>

 1: directumdm.ru (Site 2)

 Listed above are the bindings found on the selected site(s). By default all
 of them will be included, but you may either pick specific ones by typing the
 host names or identifiers (comma-separated) or filter them using one of the
 options from the menu.

 P: Pick bindings based on a search pattern
 R: Pick bindings based on a regular expression
 A: Pick *all* bindings

 Binding identifiers(s) or menu option: <Enter>

 1: directumdm.ru (Site 2)

 Continue with this selection? (y*/n) - yes

 Source generated using plugin IIS: directumdm.ru

 Friendly name '[IIS] (any site), (any host)'. <Enter> to accept or type desired name: <Enter>

 By default your source identifiers are covered by a single certificate. But
 if you want to avoid the 100 domain limit, want to prevent information
 disclosure via the SAN list, and/or reduce the operational impact of a single
 validation failure, you may choose to convert one source into multiple
 certificates, using different strategies.

 1: Separate certificate for each domain (e.g. *.example.com)
 2: Separate certificate for each host (e.g. sub.example.com)
 3: Separate certificate for each IIS site
 4: Single certificate
 C: Abort

 Would you like to split this source into multiple certificates?: <Enter>

 The ACME server will need to verify that you are the owner of the domain
 names that you are requesting the certificate for. This happens both during
 initial setup *and* for every future renewal. There are two main methods of
 doing so: answering specific http requests (http-01) or create specific dns
 records (dns-01). For wildcard identifiers the latter is the only option.
 Various additional plugins are available from
 https://github.com/win-acme/win-acme/.

 1: [http] Save verification files on (network) path
 2: [http] Serve verification files from memory
 3: [http] Upload verification files via FTP(S)
 4: [http] Upload verification files via SSH-FTP
 5: [http] Upload verification files via WebDav
 6: [dns] Create verification records manually (auto-renew not possible)
 7: [dns] Create verification records with acme-dns (https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns)
 8: [dns] Create verification records with your own script
 9: [tls-alpn] Answer TLS verification request from win-acme
 C: Abort

 How would you like prove ownership for the domain(s)?: <Enter>

 After ownership of the domain(s) has been proven, we will create a
 Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to obtain the actual certificate. The CSR
 determines properties of the certificate like which (type of) key to use. If
 you are not sure what to pick here, RSA is the safe default.

 1: Elliptic Curve key
 2: RSA key
 C: Abort

 What kind of private key should be used for the certificate?: <Enter>

 When we have the certificate, you can store in one or more ways to make it
 accessible to your applications. The Windows Certificate Store is the default
 location for IIS (unless you are managing a cluster of them).

 1: IIS Central Certificate Store (.pfx per host)
 2: PEM encoded files (Apache, nginx, etc.)
 3: PFX archive
 4: Windows Certificate Store (Local Computer)
 5: No (additional) store steps

 How would you like to store the certificate?: <Enter>

 1: [WebHosting] - Dedicated store for IIS
 2: [My] - General computer store (for Exchange/RDS)
 3: [Default] - Use global default, currently WebHosting

 Choose store to use, or type the name of another unlisted store: <Enter>

 1: IIS Central Certificate Store (.pfx per host)
 2: PEM encoded files (Apache, nginx, etc.)
 3: PFX archive
 4: Windows Certificate Store (Local Computer)
 5: No (additional) store steps

 Would you like to store it in another way too?: <Enter>

 With the certificate saved to the store(s) of your choice, you may choose one
 or more steps to update your applications, e.g. to configure the new
 thumbprint, or to update bindings.

 1: Create or update bindings in IIS
 2: Start external script or program
 3: No (additional) installation steps

 Which installation step should run first?: <Enter>

 This plugin will update *all* binding using the previous certificate in both
 Web and FTP sites, regardless of whether those bindings were created manually
 or by the program itself. Therefor you'll never need to run this installation
 step twice.

 During initial setup, it will try to make as few changes as possible to IIS
 to cover the source identifiers. If new bindings are needed, by default it
 will create those at the same site where the HTTP binding for that host was
 found.

 Create new bindings in a different site? (y/n*) - yes

 2: DirectumRX Web Site Name

 Choose site to create new bindings: <Enter>

 Choose site to create new bindings: 2

 1: Create or update bindings in IIS
 2: Start external script or program
 3: No (additional) installation steps

 Add another installation step?: <Enter>
